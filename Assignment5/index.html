        <h1 id="Red">This is the home page, the place about homes</h1>
        <p>But this paragraph has nothing to do about homes other than it not being about homes. This paragraph is really more about food, as I haven't eaten today and am rather hungry. I'm just really glad I'm not all <em> Hangry</em> because that's no fun for anyone! I would really like some tacos, or perhaps something with lots of carbs like a pasta dish with some spagetti sauce. I'll probably go get some cereal.</p>
