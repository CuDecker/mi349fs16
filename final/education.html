                  <h2>Education Background</h2>
                  <p>Curtis Decker found himself entrenched in a quaint city, Laingsburg. After touring several colleges, he found himself in love with a college just four times the size of his high school of about 400 people. Wanting to be just far enough away from his parents to learn to fly on his own, but still just close enough should anything happen he decided the tiny college 100 miles away was a perfect suit.</p>
                  <p>After two great years at Adrian and an intro web course, Curtis felt he finally had a passion. He was dedicated to web design but more importantly, to technology. He ditched his business/supply chain major and went touring again for a school with a greater focus on technology. He found a perfect match in MSU. Though being only 30 minutes away, it felt like home, he practically had grown up in this city his whole life. Plus his whole family bled green, it was a natural fit. Skip ahead a few more years and Curtis finds himself immersed in everything front-facing of web development.
