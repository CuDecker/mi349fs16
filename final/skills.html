                  <h2>My focus</h2>
                  <p>I am keen for web developer activities, especially those with aspects focused on front-end development.</p>
                  <h2>Background</h2>
                  <p>I have often been the "front-line" defense. I was always the person who received a request first and would handle it or pass it along and ask for help. I've worked as a tutor/teacher's assistant for quite a bit too. I was entrusted in taking a rubric, grading students and helping those who needed help. I think the greatest non-technical thing I've learned from both of these jobs is how important it is to avoid jargon or to learn how to change your vocabulary on the fly to allow the non-technical person to understand what you're trying to help them with.</p>

                  <span class="button" onclick="toggle()"><p>Click for my resume</p></span>

                  <h2>Portfolio</h2>
                  <p>I have a few projects I have been working on recently. Most of them are Wordpress based but I've learned a tremendous amount from working with my clients.</p>
