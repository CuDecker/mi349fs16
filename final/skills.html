                  <h2>My focus</h2>
                  <p>I am keen for web developer activities, especially those with aspects focused on front-end development.</p>
                  <h2>Background</h2>
                  <p>I have often been the "front-line" defense. I was always the person who received a request first and would handle it or pass it along and ask for help. I've worked as a tutor/teacher's assistant for some time now, going on 3 years. I have been entrusted in taking a rubric, grading students and helping those who needed help without doing the work for them. The greatest non-technical thing I've learned from this is how important it is to avoid jargon or to change your vocabulary on the fly to allow the non-technical person to understand what you're trying to help them with. It's about being precise and using metaphors that they can understand if trying to explain something inherently difficult. </p>
                  <h2>Resume</h2>
                  <span class="button" onclick="toggle()">Click for my resume</span>
                  <div id="resume">
                      <embed type="application/pdf" src="Resume.pdf" width="100%" height="900px">
                      <p class="button" onclick="toggle()">Hide Resume</p>
                  </div>
                  <h2>Portfolio</h2>
                  <p>I have a few projects I have been working on recently. Most of them are Wordpress based but I've learned a tremendous amount from working with my clients.</p>
